- A home banner  
- Information about the bakery  
- Product highlights  
- Contact details  

⚠ *Note:* This project is currently *non-responsive* for different screen sizes.  
It may not display well on mobile devices or tablets.  
*The navbar* is also *non-responsive* and does not adapt for smaller screens.  
Additionally, the tabs in the navbar do not redirect to any sections; they are purely for design purposes.
